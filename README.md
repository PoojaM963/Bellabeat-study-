How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

About the company - Bellabeat

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded ‘Bellabeat’ in 2013. This company manufactures health-focused products for women, collecting data on activity, sleep, 
stress and reproductive health. This data then provides a clearer outlook about health and habits to its users. 
Urška Sršen believes that Bellabeat has the potential to become a larger competitor in the global smart device market by analysing smart device fitness data, 
in order to gain valuable insight into how consumers use their smart devices.

As Junior Data Analyst, part of the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, we’ve been asked to focus on one Bellabeat product and analyse smart device usage data. 
Any insights will therefore help to guide marketing strategy for the company. 
We must present to Bellabeat’s executive team along with high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
